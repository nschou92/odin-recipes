# odin-recipes

In this minor project, I will be creating a very rudimentary website.

The website will consist of a homepage with links to different recipes.

The project is now complete.

I have created a landing page with three subpages that can be accessed.

They contain 3 different recipes that I like.

On each of them there has been added a picture and the recipes themselves.

This was a fun little exercise and a milestone in my journey to learn web development.
